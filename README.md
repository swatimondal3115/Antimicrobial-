nfectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become pressing 
concerns in India. We aimed to comprehensively investigate the burden of them. Infectious 
diseases remain a major public health concern in India, contributing significantly to morbidity 
and mortality. The rising threat of bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) exacerbates this 
burden, undermining treatment efficacy and increasing healthcare costs. This study 
systematically analyzes the burden of infectious diseases and the impact of bacterial AMR in 
India, leveraging data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Studies 2019 and 2021.
